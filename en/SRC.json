    "Description": "<p>SecureCoin is a fast and secure cryptographic digital currency based on Bitcoin. The specifications have been carefully chosen to maintain Bitcoins economic model of deflation. A single hashing algorithm poses a security risk because if it is compromised, the whole network is forever compromised. Multiple hashing algorithms enhance the security of the network by not only mitigating this, but also by adding an additional layer of complexity for any attacker to penetrate.</p>",
