    "Description": "<p>Bikercoin is a digital cryptocurrency that operates on a community-based standard of value using peer-to-peer (P2P) networking as the means of conducting transactions. Rather than having a central authority determine the value of the currency, its worth is determined by the number of products and services people are willing to buy or sell using Bikercoins. Bikercoins have a global value, so they can be used in any country, at any time. Bikercoin is also open-source; its architecture is public, nobody owns or controls Bikercoin and anybody can take part.</p><p>Bikercoin uses the cryptonote algorithm and is a PoW coin.Â </p>",
