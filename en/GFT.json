    "Description": "<p>Giftcoin is a groundbreaking new system designed to revolutionise charitable giving. With confidence in the charitable sector being seriously compromised, never has cultivating trust with donors been more important. Giftcoin is about creating transparency and trust in the giving process. Right now, giving money to charity is a one-directional experience. You give money, and you hope it goes where you intended it. When you give with Giftcoin, you can have absolute confidence that your money is going exactly where you intended.</p><p>Giftcoins vision is to create a world in which every time you give money to charity and good causes, you have total trust that your funds are going exactly where you want them to. By giving absolute trust and confidence, they believe donors will choose to give more money to the causes they care about. At a time in history of seemingly endless natural disasters, the refugee crises in the Middle East, and a greater divide between rich and poor than ever before, the need has never been greater for such a platform.</p><p> </p>",

    "Description": "<p>The Giftcoin vision is to offer a feeless system for end to-end giving. This means that all funds that exist within the Giftcoin system can move without any fees. To ensure a viable business model for the long-term and to make sure the platform can sustain beyond the planned token offerings, a small charge (anticipated to be 1%) will be levied for exchanging fiat into Giftcoin and vice versa. This will also incentivise users to keep funds within the Giftcoin system.
