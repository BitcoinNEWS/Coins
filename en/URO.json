    "Description": "<p>UroCoin (URO) is an X11 PoW based alternative crypto currency. Uro&#39;s focus is to try and provide a means for efficient international trade of Urea - they wish to provide a backing to the coins market capitalisation by holding Urea itself. The coin has a block time of 3 minutes and retargets using the safe gravity well. There was no premine and the recommended transaction fee is 0.1%. The total coin supply will be 1 million URO in the first six months and then 10% growth per annum to coincide with the projected growth rate of the global Urea market - as such the block reward will drop from 12 URO after the first six months to 1 URO per block in perpetuity.</p>",
