And in every ten million blocks, that reward will reduce until Octanox gets a point where the fess of the transaction is enough to sustain its miners. Meanwhile, the reward of POS system or proof of stake mining will be given to those who have a large of Octanox. The more Octanox you have, your earnings will be bigger through POS system.</span></span></p>",

Which aims to reduce the ability for scamming due to the anonymity that crypto provides. OctaGUI is a smart application that can be used to create multiple features for Octanox for example their web wallets. Octanex will be the decentralised exchange for cryptocurrency assets. Octalk is their final planned product that aims to be a decentralised social media platform that will style itself in a similar fashion to BTCtalk. </span></p><p>The ICO was launched on Livecoin exchange and had a maximum of 100,000,000 coins available. 7,905,634 coins were sold over the ICO period for $0.085/OTX.</p><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Team</strong></span></p><ul><li>Dhimas Pambudi - CEO &amp; Founder</li><li>Dr. Adeel - Developer, Project Manager</li><li>Benjamin Holmes - Community Manager</li><li>Miguel Landicho - Campaign Manager</li></ul>",
