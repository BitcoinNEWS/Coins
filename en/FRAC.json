    "Description": "<p>Fractal Coin intends to distribute 90% of its 1 million coins in the initial 28 days of mining. The coin features a new difficulty adjustment mechanism known as slingshot - the aim of which is to increase the % of controlled hashrate required for a 51% attack to over 70%. The idea is that block rewards will be based solely on transaction fees. Otherwise the coin has a 6o second block time and has a 0.5% premine.</p>",
