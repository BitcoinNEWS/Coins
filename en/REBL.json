Instead of a traditional ICO Rebellious featured a proof of Airdrop system to offer their tokens. The main goal of the Airdrop is to create a strong community dedicated to making a change to the cryptocurrency market and to ensure that every crypto-enthusiast has an equal opportunity to grow both the project and their own portfolio. REBL is an Ethereum-based ERC 20 token. Instead of using the traditional Proof-of-Work system, Rebellious&#39; ERC 20 token will utilise a Proof-of-Stake system in token format. REBL holders will earn interest on the REBL they hold in their wallets. </span></p><p><span>By <span>valuing time over buying power, Rebellious plans to build a new breed of community cryptocurrency.</span></span></p>",
