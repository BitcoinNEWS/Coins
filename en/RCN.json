The smart contracts connect agents with information on the borrower’s identity to agents that analyze the borrower’s credit risk impartially, thus standardizing credit lending through blockchain technology. A cosigner acts as a re insurer that distributes and reduces the lender’s risk and, at the same time, helps to improve the contract conditions by retaining access to the borrower’s local legal system.</span></p><p><strong>Team</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Sebastian Serrano</strong>: Founder &amp; CEO.</li><li><strong>David Garcia</strong><span>: SVP &amp; Board Member.</span></li><li><span><strong>Luciana Gruszeczka</strong><span>: Compliance Officer.</span></span></li><li><strong>Andres Fleischer</strong><span>: Head of Operations &amp; Admin.</span></li><li><span><strong>Eugenio Cocimano</strong><span>: Actuary &amp; Data Scientist.</span></span></li><li><strong>Melody Bohn</strong><span>: Controller.</span></li><li><span><strong>Juan Mendez</strong><span>: Head of Growth &amp; Content.</span></span></li><li><strong>Bruno Acorsi</strong><span>: Head of Support &amp; CX.</span></li></ul><p>Ripio will be holding its ICO on October 17, 2017.
