    "Description": "<p>Noirshares are another interesting concept as a coin as well as being a PoW/PoS coin - they also double as an equity investment for the NIG Group. The coin has a block reward reduction every 3000 blocks and difficulty adjustments each block. There are 80 NRS per block originally and the PoW phase is limited by a hard cap of 5million NRS. Transaction fees are destroyed and taken out of the system to counter the inflation of the PoS stage.</p>",
