    "Description": "<p>STARCOIN (STR) is a litecoin clone based on the Scrypt protocol - however it is a hybrid with PoW/PoS and a 30 second block time. 4 confirmations are needed for transactions and 70 for a matured mining block. Mining subsidy or reward halves every year and difficulty retargets every block. The starting block reward was set to 100 STR and, as well as transaction messaging, there are also super blocks.</p>",
