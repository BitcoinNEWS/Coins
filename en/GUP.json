Joiners who wish to enter a pool of their choice, will have to pay the pool&#39;s requisite entry fee, while <span>host will be the one who opens a custom Pool and gets dividends from its revenues.</span></p><p>All payments in Matchpool will be held in an Ether based smart contract and will be processed using Matchpool&#39;s network own token Guppies (GUP). Both the Host of the pool and its matchmakers are entitled to shares of the Pools subscription and monthly fees, paid with GUP.</p>",
