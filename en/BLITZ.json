    "Description": "<p><a href=\"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=848186.0\" target=\"_blank\">Blitz</a> is a decentralized crypto currency which seeks to provide real world application of blockchain technology through the tools and platform Bitalize has to offer.</p><p>Coin added by <a href=\"http://chopcoin.io\" target=\"_blank\">@chopcoin</a> Team</p>",
    "Features": "<p><strong>Large Distribution &amp; Low Inflation</strong><br /><br />78.5 million ClubCoin was mined to start and these coins are being distributed to BitClub Network members. See disclaimer below. No new coins will be created using Proof-of-Work method, all new coins will be issued from the 20% yearly interest paid to holders of ClubCoin who are staking their coins. This drops in half every 2 years.<br /> <br /><br /><strong>Built-in Users = Adoption<br /></strong><br />ClubCoin was first introduced to BitClub Network members as a strategic way to distribute the coins across a global network of users. This model gives ClubCoin a unique advantage over most coins in the market as it will continue to be issued and distributed worldwide to a fast growing user base.<br /> <br /><br /><strong>Blockchain Security<br /></strong><br />ClubCoin has it&#39;s own Blockchain and distributed network of nodes that make it very secure against attacks and hard to get 51% consensus. Other digital currencies that are only Proof-of-work face issues due to their reliability on large-scale mining operations. ClubCoin also boasts a powerful Block Explorer.<br /> <br /><br /><strong>Merchant Platform<br /></strong><br />A new Merchant Platform is being built that will allow online and brick &amp; mortar businesses to accept ClubCoin risk free, within a secure and reliable environment. Since many members will be eager to use this platform we have created a very strategic way to sign up new merchants. We have big plans for ongoing development of the entire ClubCoin ecosystem.</p>",
