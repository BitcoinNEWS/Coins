    "Description": "<p>ClickCoin was started as Yobit ICO. Only 225000 out of 1000000 coins were sold, the rest was burned by Yobit. The original developer abandoned the coin and itÂ has been taken over by the community, old development fund address with 245000 user donated coins has been blocked via hardfork so old dev has no control on any significant CLICK amount anymore. ClickCoin is a Proof of Stake cryptocurrency.</p>",
