    "Description": "<p>BitcoinTX is an attempt at reformulating Bitcoin with Proof of Stake and using the X11 algorithm. Initially there was a PoW phase. After that, it was all PoS but there was a problem in the \"lucky stake\" code. The original developer(s) walked away. After that, they licked their wounds, started a little \"crowd-fund\" for a new developer to fix the code and managed to go forward with the project!</p>",
