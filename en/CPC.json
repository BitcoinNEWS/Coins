    "Description": "<p>CapriCoin, or CPC, is a crypto currency based on the X11 algorithm and is both proof of stake and proof of work. The coin has a large premine of 200,000,000 of the total supply of 208,000,000 - 25% is distributed - 50 million is reserved for staisybit and 99 million reserved for inhouse staking... and 1 million reserved for the development team. The proof of stake drops from 2% by 50% increments per year to year 24. The coin has a large premine which looks to be unethical.Â </p>",
