In the absolute start-up phase, approximately the first six months, only proof-of-work mining is required. Once initially mined coins will become available for deposit, the system will gradually and automatically shift toward the combined pow/pod algorithm. The deposit system does not prevent proof-of-work mining, instead it acts as a force pushing miners towards adding deposits.</span></p>",
