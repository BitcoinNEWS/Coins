The company offers users an investment alternative called <em>crowdvouching</em>, which allows customers to make money vouching for people who need an urgent loan.</p><p>This system works in a similar fashion with peer-2-peer lending, but customers do not lend money to each other directly. Instead, they vouch for borrowers who apply for a loan through lending partners.</p><p>Customers can find borrowers that are looking for their loan’s guarantors. The voucher can check the borrower’s profile and choose whether to vouch for the borrower if their default risk and earning amount suit them.</p>",
