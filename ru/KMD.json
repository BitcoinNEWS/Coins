    "Description": "<p><span>Komodo is a privacy-centric cryptocurrency that combines the anonymity of ZCash with the security of Bitcoin. Using a new consensus mechanism developed by the Komodo team, delayed Proof of Work, Komodo blocks can be notarized using the Bitcoin blockchain. KMD is issued through an Equihash-based PoW</span><span> protocol, and the new block information is sent to pre-voted notary nodes. These nodes insert the Komodo block information on the BTC blockchain by creating a custom transaction. This system ensures that in order to \"hack\" komodo, one would have to rewrite both chains.</span><br /><br /><span>Komodo uses Zero Knowledge Proofs to provide 100% anonymous transactions, that are now secured with Bitcoin&#39;s hash rate</span>.</p>",
