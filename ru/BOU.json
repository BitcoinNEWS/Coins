Their Voting System on the Blockchain requires two steps: ID authentication and vote submission. Authentication in Boulé Voting Technology is based on the Ethereum Blockchain.<br /><br />Smart Contract will be public and preview available to be verified, same as the exit poll at the end of the voting process. The Elector Identification Process starts from the National Security Number and it requires several simple and secure steps explained on this page. After identification, electors can vote. The Vote can be modified several times until the end of the voting period. Once the voting period is ended, the transaction is confirmed and it is not possible to change it or to remove it from the Blockchain and it will be recorded forever. It will be impossible to associate Voter&#39;s Identity with the vote through the transaction.</p>",
