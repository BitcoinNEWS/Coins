Combined with tools to aid developers in distributing and monetizing their software, Golem altogether changes the way compute-intensive tasks are both organized and executed. Golem is set to become one of the key building blocks of future Internet by providing a platform for decentralized microservices. And, by substantially lowering the price of computations, complex applications such as CGI rendering, scientific calculation, and machine learning become more accessible to everyone. Golem is built using Ethereum smart contracts as a transaction system for nano-payments within the network. <span>Golem Network Tokens (GNT) will serve as a secure medium for all transactions within the Golem Network.</span></span></p><p><strong>Team</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Julian Zawistowski</strong>:<span> </span><span>CEO, Founder.</span> (<a href=\"https://pl.linkedin.com/in/julian-zawistowski-352478\" target=\"_blank\">LinkedIn</a>);</li><li><strong>Piotr Janiuk</strong>:<span> </span><span>CTO, Co-Founder</span><span>.</span><span> (</span><a href=\"https://pl.linkedin.com/in/viggith\" target=\"_blank\"><span>LinkedIn</span></a><span>);</span></li><li><strong><span>Andrzej Regulski</span></strong>:<span> </span><span>COO, Co-Founder</span><span>.</span><span> (</span><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrzej-regulski-5298a818\" target=\"_blank\"><span>LinkedIn</span></a><span>);</span></li><li><strong><span>Aleksandra Skrzypczak</span></strong><span>:<span> </span>Lead Software Engineer<span>,<span> </span>Co-Founder<span>.</span></span><span> (</span><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/aleksandra-skrzypczak-57016a8a\" target=\"_blank\"><span>LinkedIn</span></a><span>);</span></span></li><li><span><strong>Alex Leverington</strong><span>:<span> </span>P2P Engineer, Advisor<span>.</span><span> (</span><a href=\"https://ch.linkedin.com/in/alexleverington\" target=\"_blank\"><span>LinkedIn</span></a><span>);</span></span></span></li><li><span><strong>Paweł Bylica</strong><span>:<span> </span>Lead Ethereum Engineer<span>.</span><span> (</span><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/pawelbylica\" target=\"_blank\"><span>LinkedIn</span></a><span>);</span></span></span></li></ul><p><span>The ICO reached its cap of 820,000 ETH within 29 minutes at a rate of 1000GNT/1ETH totaling a USD value of $8,600,000.
