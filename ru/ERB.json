A point system has been devised rewarding specific driving behaviors that reduce congestion on the roads, and allow traffic to flow more smoothly. This, in turn, will alleviate many of the stresses that typically come with everyday driving, and thus reduce \"road rage\" incidents and accidents.</span><br /><span>. </span></p>",
