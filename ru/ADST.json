The ICO contract will then enter the allocation phase. Users will have 1 month to decide whether they are happy with development results and want to be allocated with custom blockchain tokens. If not – they can always resell their tokens to the ICO contract. The minimum goal for the crowdsale is $1 million and the starting price is $0.10</p><p> </p><p>The ADST ICO counted with a bonus campaign and will not be minable.</p><p>Bonus Structure:</p><p>1 – 10M tokens: 0.1 USD Constant price until minimum financing level has been reached</p><p>Over 10M tokens: 0.1 USD * ( (token no) / 10 M) After this, token price rises linearly with token supply</p><p> </p>",
