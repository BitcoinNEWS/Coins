The Elastic miners are then motivated to offer their computational resources in exchange for a portion of those XEL coins.</span></p><p><span>Elastic offers potential buyers a large parallel computation cluster composed of many CPUs and GPUs supplied by the miners. The network is  powered by its own PoW cryptocurrency (XEL) and provides a market-based mechanism to buy and sell computational resources.</span></p>",
