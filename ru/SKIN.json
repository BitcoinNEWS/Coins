The term “skin” is derived from the typical function of these virtual items: changing the appearance of a player’s in-game avatar, weapons, or equipment. Skin tokens will let users Bet, game, buy and sell in online marketplaces. The August roadmap aims to release the exchange platform, trading platform and the implementation for an API for accepting payments on third-party gaming services.</span></p><p><span>A 20% discount for the first three days was offered.</span></p>",
