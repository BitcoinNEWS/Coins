    "Description": "<p>The BitBar (BTB) crypto coin is a mixture of Novacoin, Fairnova and Rarecoin. It is a unique alternative to bitcoin and it&#39;s first-mover advantages over the glut of currencies that launched during the summer of 2013. It is resistant to Asic miners and dedicated mining hardware, meaning specialist mining equipment built into chips is very costly to manufacture efficiently - but that could soon change. Bitbar is a technology and services company that provides high-performance mobile software development and testing solutions based on widely adopted open standards.</p>",
