    "Description": "<p>GTC is a decentralized and open-source cryptocurrency that offers privacy and selective transparency of transactions. GTC payments are published on a public blockchain, but the sender, recipient, and amount of a transaction remains private.<br />GTC is based on peer-reviewed cryptographic research, and built on an open source platform based on battle-tested codebase. The ultimate goal is the addition of privacy. GTC uses advanced cryptographic techniques, namely zero-knowledge proofs, to guarantee the validity of transactions without revealing additional information about them.</p>",
